// SHA256
// SHA(Secure Hashing Algorithm)-256 is a variant of SHA-2 developed by the National Security Agency in 2001. 
// SHA256 takes arbitrary size message/data as input and produces a hash value of 256 bits. 
// SHA256 is used by some of the most popular authentication protocols like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS),  
// Secure Shell (SSH) and many more. 
// Regarding Blockchain specifically, cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, use SHA256 for verifying transactions. 
// It is also an integral part of Bitcoinâ€™s Proof of Work consensus mechanism.
